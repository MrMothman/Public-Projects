# Asked ChatGpt to give me 20 hardest assignments in c/c++
1. **Triple Pointer Magic:**
   Write a function that accepts a triple pointer to an integer and modifies the value it points to.

2. **Memory Allocator:**
   Implement a custom memory allocator using malloc and free functions.

3. **Abstracted Geometry Classes:**
   Design a set of abstract classes representing geometric shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles, and implement concrete subclasses for each.

4. **Static Singleton:**
   Implement a thread-safe singleton class using the static keyword.

5. **External Sorting:**
   Write a program to perform external sorting on a large dataset stored in a file, utilizing the extern keyword to manage memory efficiently.

6. **Struct-Based Database:**
   Create a simple in-memory database using structs to represent tables, rows, and columns, with functions to insert, delete, and query data.

7. **Graph Algorithms:**
   Implement graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm to find shortest paths between nodes in a weighted graph.

8. **Parallel Sorting:**
   Develop a parallel sorting algorithm using threads or OpenMP to improve the efficiency of sorting large arrays.

9. **Database Indexing:**
   Design and implement a B-tree data structure to index a database table for efficient search and retrieval operations.

10. **Network Protocol Parser:**
    Write a program to parse network packets of a specific protocol using structs to represent packet headers and data fields.

11. **Image Processing:**
    Create a program to perform basic image processing tasks like convolution, edge detection, or histogram equalization using memory manipulation techniques.

12. **Custom STL Container:**
    Implement a custom container similar to std::vector or std::map with support for dynamic resizing, iterators, and generic element types.

13. **Game AI:**
    Develop an AI for a simple game (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe or Chess) using algorithms like minimax with alpha-beta pruning or Monte Carlo Tree Search.

14. **Dynamic Code Generation:**
    Write a program that dynamically generates machine code at runtime to perform a specific computation, leveraging the flexibility of function pointers.

15. **Operating System Kernel Module:**
    Create a kernel module for a Unix-like operating system to add a new system call or device driver, requiring knowledge of kernel-level programming and memory management.

16. **Template Metaprogramming:**
    Explore template metaprogramming techniques to implement compile-time computations or optimizations, such as calculating factorials or generating Fibonacci sequences.

17. **Network Routing Algorithm:**
    Design and implement a routing algorithm for a computer network, considering factors like latency, bandwidth, and network topology.

18. **Blockchain Implementation:**
    Develop a simplified version of a blockchain system, including data structures for blocks, transactions, and a consensus mechanism like Proof of Work.

19. **Compiler Frontend:**
    Build a basic compiler frontend to parse and analyze source code written in a custom programming language, generating intermediate representations for further processing.

20. **Quantum Computing Simulation:**
    Create a simulation of a quantum computing system using C/C++ to model quantum gates, qubits, and algorithms like Shor's algorithm or Grover's algorithm.
